ASA DataFest<small><sup>TM</sup></small> at the University of Edinburgh is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, social activities, social media, and other online media. ASA DataFest<small><sup>TM</sup></small> participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the  organizers.

This code of conduct applies to all participants, including organizers, consultants, judges, and helpers and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online, on ASA DataFest<small><sup>TM</sup></small> Community, and event specific Teams channels, and social media.

Participants agree to:

- Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert any organizers in person.
- Take care of each other. Alert a member of the organizers if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

For more on the code of conduct, please see the [ASA Meeting Code of Conduct](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Meetings/Meeting-Conduct-Policy.aspx?hkey=cd6c7609-5d24-4f07-b0e3-8606ca98de47).

If any attendee engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the event. (If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact the organizers with a concise description of your grievance.)

We may take some photos during the event to capture the experience. If you’d rather not be included, please let one of the organizers know.

We welcome your feedback on this and every other aspect of ASA DataFest<small><sup>TM</sup></small> events, and we thank you for working with us to make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates.
